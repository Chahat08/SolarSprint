# SolarSprint
A game web application made using javascript on the Django Framework.

Solar Sprint is in its essence an endless runner which is reminescent of the retro arcade era of gameing.

You can currently explore three different planets of the (fictional) planetary system of Solas. 
Each planet looks different and provides different challenges.

The rules are simple: Press space to jump, land back on platforms and dodge enemies.
Most of all have fun!
